# Task 1 

 1. Priority Scheduling – Gantt Chart Diagram
 
| PID | Burst Time | Priority |
| --- | ---------- | -------- |
| P1  | 4          | 1        |
| P3  | 2          | 2        |
| P2  | 3          | 5        |

|   P1   |  P3  |    P2    |
-----------------------------------------------------
0        4      6         9



Explanation:

P1 runs first (highest priority)

Then P3

Then P2

# Task 2

Enter total number of blocks: 10
Enter number of files: 2

--- File 1 ---
Enter starting block for file 1: 2
Enter length of file 1: 3
File 1 allocated from block 2 to 4

--- File 2 ---
Enter starting block for file 2: 4
Enter length of file 2: 4
File 2 cannot be allocated.

Final Block Allocation:
Block 0 → Free
Block 1 → Free
Block 2 → Allocated
Block 3 → Allocated
Block 4 → Allocated
Block 5 → Free
Block 6 → Free
Block 7 → Free
Block 8 → Free
Block 9 → Free


# Task 3

Enter total number of blocks: 10
Enter number of files: 1

--- File 1 ---
Enter index block for file 1: 2
Enter number of data blocks: 3
Enter block numbers: 3 4 5
File 1 allocated successfully.
Index Block: 2
Data Blocks: [3, 4, 5]

Final Block Allocation Status:
Block 0 -> Free
Block 1 -> Free
Block 2 -> Allocated
Block 3 -> Allocated
Block 4 -> Allocated
Block 5 -> Allocated
Block 6 -> Free
Block 7 -> Free

# Task 4 

FIRST FIT

Process 1 (212 KB) → Partition 2
Process 2 (417 KB) → Partition 5
Process 3 (112 KB) → Partition 2
Process 4 (426 KB) → Not Allocated
Remaining Partition Sizes: [100, 176, 200, 300, 183]

BEST FIT

Process 1 (212 KB) → Partition 3
Process 2 (417 KB) → Partition 5
Process 3 (112 KB) → Partition 1
Process 4 (426 KB) → Not Allocated
Remaining Partition Sizes: [ -12, 500, -12, 300, 172]

WORST FIT

Process 1 (212 KB) → Partition 5
Process 2 (417 KB) → Partition 2
Process 3 (112 KB) → Partition 5
Process 4 (426 KB) → Not Allocated
Remaining Partition Sizes: [100, 83, 200, 300, 276]


# Task 5

Enter total memory size: 1024
Enter partition size: 256
Enter number of processes: 3

Enter size of Process 1: 200 → allocated  
Enter size of Process 2: 130 → allocated  
Enter size of Process 3: 300 → NOT allocated  
Total Internal Fragmentation = 256-200 + 256-130 = 182 KB
